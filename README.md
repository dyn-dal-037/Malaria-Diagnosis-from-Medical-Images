# Malaria Diagnosis from Medical Images

This repository implements a **deep learning–based system for malaria diagnosis** using microscopic blood smear images. The project focuses on classifying infected and uninfected samples using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and standard medical image preprocessing techniques.

---

## Overview

Malaria diagnosis traditionally relies on manual examination of blood smear slides, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project explores how supervised deep learning models can assist in automated malaria detection from medical images.

The work emphasizes **image preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation**, providing a practical introduction to medical imaging–based classification pipelines.
